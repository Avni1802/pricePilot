Complete documentation
Success Criteria:

# Both test cases working
curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"country": "US", "query":"iPhone 16 Pro, 128GB"}'

curl -X POST "https://your-app.railway.app/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"country": "IN", "query": "boAt Airdopes 311 Pro"}'
